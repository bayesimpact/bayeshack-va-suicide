_How can data predict and prevent veteran suicide?_

## Prompt

Veterans are at a 50% higher risk of suicide than the United States national average. A number of studies have been conducted to understand the clinical and behavioral risk factors and their causal relationship with self harm; in particular, serious mental health trauma is a significant contributor to suicial behavior among veterans, and the public at large.

Use openly available data sets (including the surveys and government reports attached here) to create models to better understand and predict suicide among veterans as a foundation for more targeted and proactive care. Additionally, applications for point of care analysis and the development of better predictive classifiers or new methods for data collection can be critical parts of getting veterans the care they need.
